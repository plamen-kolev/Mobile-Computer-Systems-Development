EmoteChat is a mobile-first chat app that enables real time communication. It features a karma system, which enables participants to send rude emojis when their messages become ignored by the recipient.

To begin using the application, a user is required to log in first or create an account. Before that, the find friend feature is disabled
On the right screen, the user mike has already been logged in

On the left, sam is about to become a member

During the register screen, upon filling the details correctly, the register button becomes available

Now, back in the home page, sam can now log in

If fields are left blank or the credentials are invalid, the system will notify the user

Sam now logs in successfully and can search for friends

The search bar dynamically finds users in real time

Now Sam adds mike as a friend and awaits for mike's approval

Upon accepting the friend request, both can now begin a conversation

The website provides two tiers of emoticons, the first ones can be used whenever the user wants, the second only when the user has enough karma points

Now both participants can start chatting in real time

Here you can see both parties exchanging emoticons

When opening the second tier of emoticons, mike has 0 karma at the moment, making all of them locked.
5 Karma points are gained as a result of a recipient ignoring a message. The sender also gets notified that the message has been ignored.

At the moment, a message is considered ignored withing 15 seconds for demonstration purposes.

To illustrate gaining karma in real time, mike will send couple of messages and sam will ignore them.

Now mike has few karma points, and more rude emoticons become unlocked. He also now knows that messages have been ignored.

Upon using a rude emoticon, karma points are deducted, and some emoticons become unavailable.

The message exchange is kept both on the front end and on the back end, so upon joining a session again, all the messages persist.

This concludes the demo
